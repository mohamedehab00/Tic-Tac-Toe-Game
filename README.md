# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This project consists of developing and implementing a computer program that plays tic tac toe against another player.

Tic tac toe is a two player game (one of them being your computer program). The two
players take turns putting marks on a 3x3 board. The player who first gets 3 of his/her
marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins the game, and the other
loses the game.
